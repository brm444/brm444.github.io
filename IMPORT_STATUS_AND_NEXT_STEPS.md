## üöß API Import Challenges

The hosted Talkyard API has restrictions:
- `/-/v0/upsert` endpoint returns "413 Request Entity Too Large" 
- Some endpoints return "403 Forbidden" on hosted instances
- API may be limited to self-hosted Talkyard installations

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Contact Talkyard Support (Recommended)
1. **Email Talkyard support** with your `talkyard_comments_import.json` file
2. **Reference**: They help with Disqus imports, likely can assist with WordPress imports too
3. **Include**: Your site URL (`https://site-1hamqpkqkr.talkyard.net`) and blog URLs
4. **Mention**: You have 23 comments in proper Talkyard JSON format ready for import

### Option 2: Manual Recreation (Fallback)
If automated import isn't possible, the comments could be manually recreated:
- Only 23 comments total, manageable to add manually
- Preserve original dates and author names
- Focus on the KC/QMGS discussion (most valuable content)

### Option 3: Try Self-Hosted Talkyard
- Set up self-hosted Talkyard instance temporarily
- Import comments using full API access
- Migrate to hosted version (if possible)

## üíé Most Valuable Content

Your KC Lagos vs QMGS school song discussion is incredibly valuable - it includes:
- **International connections** between Nigerian and English schools
- **Historical research** from both sides
- **Alumni networking** across decades
- **Cultural heritage** discussions

These conversations deserve to be preserved and continued on your new platform.
