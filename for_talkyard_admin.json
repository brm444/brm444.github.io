Our School Song is a proud part of our heritage and, like you we are very fond of it. I can only assume a former Marian was somehow involved in the early foundations of your school - it would be interesting if we could find the link between our schools."

He was originally an officer in the South Staffordshire regiment, which recruited heavily in Walsall, so may have been a former student at QM."
