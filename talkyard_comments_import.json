To realise effective digital transformation within the health sector across the developing world, there is a strong need for solid foundations. That means digital forms of ID and verification, civil registration, payment (digital transactions and money transfers), data exchange, and information systems themselves. We are working specifically with governments on delivering those and realising effective digital transformation. \n\nHappy to discuss if helpful!"
