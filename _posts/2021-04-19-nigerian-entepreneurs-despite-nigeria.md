Nigeria is a country of extremes. It is the country of limitless tech
opportunity and the country with the highest proportion of poor people. As a
result, investor sentiment swings wildly. We're either the darkest part of the
dark continent, or the bright spot for opportunity.

Today, Nigeria is in the incandescent phase aka "The future is so bright it
burns my eyes".

But why now? Headline acquisitions and fundraising are lagging indicators. The
hard work of building a company worth acquiring happens well before TechCrunch.
Also, Nigeria's economy has continued on the same wobbly path as it has for the
past decade. Something else is going on.

## Acquisitions and Fundraising news are smokescreens

The last 12 months have been amazing for the Nigerian tech scene. Paystack was
acquired by Stripe. Flutterwave reached unicorn status. Jumia went from $3 per
share in April 2020 to $62 in November of the same year.

But these stand in opposition to Nigeria's economic reality. The fundamentals of
the economy are in free-fall. Nigeria's jobless rate
has [quadrupled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/nigeria-unemployment-rate-rises-to-second-highest-on-global-list) over
the last 5 years and today, less than half of Nigeria's labor force is fully
employed. Violence and insurgency threaten lives and property in Nigeria's
north-east. It is [harder](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/rankings) to
start a business in Nigeria than in Egypt, South Africa, or Ghana. Permits take
months instead of days,
and [incoherent](https://nairametrics.com/2021/04/09/sec-declares-chaka-bamboo-risevest-and-trove-illegal-trading-platforms/) [government](https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/11/lagos-ride-hailing-regulations-august/) [policy](https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/10/why-you-can-no-longer-buy-or-register-new-sim-cards-in-nigeria-for-now/) is
a cloud over startups that could rain any moment. All this as the population
inches towards 300 million by 2050.

Despite these dire circumstances, there's still opportunity.

## What Nigerian entrepreneurs are doing differently

Successful Nigerian entrepreneurs are fearless and many go against conventional
advice. They try new business models and are starting to attract capital on
their own terms.

### THEY BUILD FOR BUILDERS

Businesses are the primary customers for 4 of 5
Nigerian [startups](https://techpoint.africa/2021/03/23/y-combinator-w21-demo-day/) in
Y Combinator W21. This is also true for the [W20
batch](https://www.benjamindada.com/five-nigerian-startups-yc-winter-2020/).

These B2B startups are important because they make entrepreneurship less risky.
The businesses use the startup's services to make money so they are easier to
get and keep. Also, the more customers you get, the less sensitive you are to
individual businesses.

Because businesses use the startups to make their lives easier, they are easier
to acquire and retain. Today, Paystack and Flutterwave make it possible for
businesses to pay and get paid. They eliminate an important business risk for
other businesses. These B2B startups also enable new business models that were
previously impossible. Many of the savings, stock trading, and food delivery
apps are only possible because of these B2B companies that handle, say, payments
or identity verification.

These B2B startups provide the building blocks for other entrepreneurs. Over the
next few years, the best companies will build for other builders.

### THEY BUILD FOR THE CONSUMERS IN THE MIDDLE

Nigeria's upper class is minuscule relative to the rest of the population. Yet,
because of the size of the country, the middle class remains a significant
market. There's not enough of the upper class to build a big consumer business
and the lowest income classes are either too poor or too expensive to serve. The
opportunity is in the middle class. These customers' needs are not met by the
current solutions, and the high-end options are out of reach either because
they're too expensive, or for other structural reasons (e.g., I can't use Venmo
for P2P in Nigeria because licenses)

The startup that comes to mind here
is [uLesson](http://www.afrobility.com/uLesson). Their product, education, is one
that most want. Nigeria's upper middle class can afford to send their children
to the best schools. They hire private tutors for after-school classes. The rest
of the middle class have to make do with the available schools and find ways to
supplement their children's education. For these customers, uLesson provides an
affordable, technology-enhanced supplement. They price this product on the
middle-class' willingness to pay, and have recently raised prices to reflect
this (and of course, to cover their costs).

See this [HBR
article](https://hbr.org/2011/01/new-business-models-in-emerging-markets) for
more on building for customers in the middle.

### THEY BUILD FOR THE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS

This is more relevant to services or software. Services are unrestricted by
physical borders, and in most cases have near-zero marginal costs.

This is already happening. Startups like Moneymie are going after the immigrant
population using remittances and money transfer as a hook. Individual creators
are selling NFTs
and [making](https://www.coindesk.com/the-nft-craze-is-helping-nigerian-artists-go-global) a
lot of money. Sight unseen, a
Nigerian [produced](https://www.pulse.ng/entertainment/music/ransom-beatz-tells-pulse-about-working-with-tekashi-6ix9ine-ramoon-runtown-dizzie/x53ncw9) a
billboard-charting song for [Tekashi
6ix9ine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6ix9ine).

Startups that serve international customers develop good habits as these
customers tend to have a high quality bar. At the same time, the Nigerian
entrepreneur can provide these services at a much lower cost with better
margins. Shola Akinlade, Paystack CEO, built and sold a software solution to
200,000 international customers before starting Paystack. The best customers for
Nigerian entrepreneurs may not be in Nigeria or even Africa.

Whatever happens, entrepreneurs need to keep building. Nigeria's collective and
individual success will have to happen despite the current macro trends.
