People worry about starting projects in crowded spaces. Peter Thiel
says [competition is for
losers]("https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536")($).
Kevin Kelly, the founder of Wired magazine, says you should [work on something
nobody has a name for]("https://www.nfx.com/post/kevin-kelly-nfx-podcast/").
Everybody wants to work on a new thing or do something that has never been done.

However, for every company that created a category, there are more that entered
crowded markets. Facebook was not the first social network, and Google was not
the first search engine. This is as true for individual creators as it is for
businesses.

When does it make sense to go where others rush in?

People have been concerned about crowded markets for centuries. Everybody was
printing books after Gutenberg's invention[1](#fn1). I've read that reducing
the cost to create content reduces the value of all content created. By this
logic, the mobile phone, which makes it easy to record audio and video, reduces
the value of all created content.

This isn't true. In fact, the opposite happens. The more people can create
content, *the better the best content becomes*. For example, it's trivial to
write and share a newsletter, but few do this as well as [Byrne
Hobart]("https://diff.substack.com/")or [Packy
McCormick]("https://www.notboring.co/"). Something else is happening.

The lower barrier to entry creates new opportunities. It allows creators to
differentiate themselves. Some do by finding a niche. For example, the most
popular newsletters create content for a narrow niche, or [1000 true
fans]("https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/"). At least they start
there; Matt Levine's
[newsletter]("https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine?sref=pMuvbz8X")
is for finance nerds but has gone
[mainstream]("https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/matt-levine-bloomberg.html").

There is also the opportunity to differentiate by providing higher quality or a
different approach to solving the problem. Google developed a better way to
search by analyzing the relationship between websites. Facebook took advantage
of network density and engagement in US college campuses.

The next time you walk away from something because "many people are doing it",
remind yourself that is not a good enough reason. There is second order question
to ask about if you can differentiate yourself in this space

1. Fifteen million books were printed in the first 42 years of the movable printing press, more than have been printed in the preceding 1000 years. [https://www.uh.edu/engines/indiana.htm](https://www.uh.edu/engines/indiana.htm) [↩︎](#ffn1)
