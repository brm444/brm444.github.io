People are too quick to dismiss the things they do not understand and throw around the "idiot" term if something doesn't immediately make sense.

I listened to two podcasts on a four hour drive this past weekend. And they were both interesting for different reasons.

Dave Portnoy on Bloomberg Business - [link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2020-10-02/dave-portnoy-on-the-business-of-sports-media-podcast)

Dave Portnoy is the founder of Barstool sports, a "men's lifestyle" publication that combines crassness, humour and sports to develop a cult following. He is also the star of Davy Day Trader Global (DDTG), his livestream of his experience trading stocks. He's put up to $5 million of his own money into his day trading account and has popularized the saying - "stonks always go up"

To limit Barstool sports to just a juvenile venture glorifying male frat culture is incomplete. Dave Portnoy built this from scratch, starting Barstool in 2003 as a weekly newspaper about gambling. He did everything himself for almost a decade - handing out newspapers in Boston's subway stations, selling ads, and writing under different pen names. In January 2020, he sold Barstool sports to Penn National Gaming for $163 million where he continues to operate Barstool as part of an publicly-listed company

Barstool's competitive advantage is its rabid audience and its ability to sell things to that audience. Portnoy has 1.8 million followers on Twitter and his most popular videos get more than a million views. This made Barstool the perfect acquisition target as a high-value customer acquisition platform. Now that you have the customers, you can sell anything to them and charge for access to them. Ads is one way - but it's not high-value enough.

Enter gaming. In 2018, the US supreme court struck down a law that previously banned sports betting, and left the decision to the states. This set off a bidding war for businesses looking to partner or acquire Barstool (and other businesses like it). Barstool Sports' customers are the perfect customer for betting agencies - young and with some disposable income. In theory, a betting company who partners with / buys Barstool Sports can access customers cheaply through Barstool's network of podcasts and content creators. Contrast this with the other betting companies - say, Draft Kings and Fan Duel who have to buy expensive TV ads to go after the same customer.&nbsp; It appears sports gaming has the highest LTV for the average barstool customer and that's what makes the acquisition interesting (and profitable). And it's looking good so far - customers have placed almost $80 million in bets placed on the Barstool-branded app in the first month of its debut.

Barstool is not alone in this - there's all kinds of social media influencers - but not many of them have managed to build a community of this size based on content. Mr Beast does wild crazy stunts like watching paint dry or giving out a large sums of money if you can keep your finger on the app. That's the target. In some ways, the "sports" of Barstool is not as important as who the customer is. Essentially build a community of users that have spending power or high LTV to someone and you can make a killing of it. Do what you do creating content and nurturing the community, and outsource monetization to a parent company or a partnership. The internet has created and provided outsized rewards to community gardening.
