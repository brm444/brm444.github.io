Nigerian startups have a person. This person signs the transactional and
follow-up emails, follows up with customers on promotions and acts as the
virtual face of the company. These are actual people, not manufactured names for
a Helpdesk request. For example,
[Uche](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ucheokafor/) is the city manager for
Taxify in Lagos and the other people work with their startups. This would be
like in 2011, when Uber launches in New York, and all the city manager signs all
receipts and ride confirmations.

This is very different from the asset-light, "Here's a link to our help page"
approach to customer service of western tech companies. These Nigerian startups
discard the corporate veneer to become human, while the startups in the US are
more likely to want to resemble a corporation.

In Nigeria, people love to complain about these accounts. They send too many
emails and are too aggressive. However, they perform an under-appreciated
function: They humanize the consumer startups that want to change human
behavior. You may not trust a new online-only bank, but maybe you will trust
Nosa from Kuda. This meets the customer expectation that there's someone you can
call when things go wrong with this new product or service.

This is just one of many ways that building a tech company in Nigeria is
different from conventional Silicon Valley.
