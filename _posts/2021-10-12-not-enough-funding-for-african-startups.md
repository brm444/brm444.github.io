African startups have raised more money in Q3 2021 than [they did in
2020]("https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/q3-2021-2020#:~:text=The%20amount%20raised%20in%20Q3%202021%20is%20equivalent%20to%20the%20full%20amount%20raised%20in%202020.").
Yet that is not even enough, and neither does it suggest a bubble in African
startup investing.

Like all capital markets, Africa is downstream of loose western monetary policy.
Interest rates are low and investors are hungry for yield. Despite being high
risk with many countries facing [economic
distress]("https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/Views/DisplayPublication.aspx?type=document&IdPdf=41794"),
African Eurobonds are [4x
oversubscribed]("https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2021/09/22/foreign-investors-rush-nigerias-eurobond-oversubscribe-four-times/") .
There is money sloshing around the global economy looking for a place to rest.
Why not Africa's startups?

Skeptics say these companies cannot justify these sky-high valuations. The true
market is small, customers cannot pay, and property rights are inconsistent.
That may be true, but even in the worst case scenarios, the impact will be
limited. Some Many investors will lose money, sure, but they knew the game
before they started playing it. No singular implosion will be the reason
investor sentiment turns. Case in point: Jumia. Even in the depths of its
rollercoaster public market journey, African investment continued growing.

It's also not that much money. Relative to Africa's population, economies,
infrastructure deficit, or any other metric, startup fundraising has a long way
to go. No African country is as developed country as Japan that [lacks for
nothing]("https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/12/the-surprising-wealth-and-success-of-japan/67302/")?

Africa's startup problems need asset heavy solutions. Your startup wants to
build Electronic Health Records software? You need to [pay for internet,
electricity and on-site support]("{%).It is not enough to build a successful
drug procurement platform for pharmacies, you must also[operate your
own.]("https://qz.com/africa/1582487/ghanas-mpharma-buys-kenya-pharmacy-haltons/").
There's no USPS for Africa's Amazon to piggyback on. In the West, you optimize
your Facebook ads to find a seam and you're off to the races. Some asset-light
companies exist, but these are the exceptions that prove the rule.

Fundraising has positive externalities. When done right, these vast sums of
money will buy African services, hire Africans and build infrastructure and
services for Africans. In the US, the 2000s dot-com bubble built
the [infrastructure]("https://ideas.ted.com/an-eye-opening-look-at-the-dot-com-bubble-of-2000-and-how-it-shapes-our-lives-today/") for
a new generation of internet companies. Wages for skilled workers will go up as
productivity increase. More young people will be attracted to a career in
technology and consider starting a business themselves.

Finally, the opportunity is massive. People are coming online faster than ever.
Africa's internet usage [growth over the last 20
years]("https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats1.htm#:~:text=43.0%20%25-,12%2C975%20%25,-255%2C412%2C900") is
many times larger the ["Jeff Bezos
number"]("https://samir-s.medium.com/how-one-statistic-inspired-jeff-bezos-to-start-amazon-41ef79690543").
Data costs are falling and will [continue to do
so]("https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/google-facebook-tackle-new-subsea-cable-routes-asia-africa"),
even as more of this young, mobile-first population comes online. The world is
only just starting to pay attention. African entrepreneurs need the capital to
build for these people. Keep it coming.
