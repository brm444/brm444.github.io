I read books, ask questions and connect the dots. I spend my free time going down the rabbit holes that interest me. Technology, Design, Economics, Finance are the ares that I find interesting. This blog is my outlet to write about those things.

I have worked in startups, management consulting, and have an MBA. Currently, I work as a Product Manager in Seattle.
